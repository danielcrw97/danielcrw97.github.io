<p> The following are some personal and academic projects for which I was the sole programmer.

<p>Global lighting is the problem of rendering non-direct light in Computer Graphics. This project uses photon mapping to solve the
problem, sending 'photons' out from light sources and storing them in special data structures called photon maps. These maps make it 
more efficient to find the closest photons during raytracing, and therefore make it easier to simulate all light paths.</br> 

The result (as can be seen in the example image below) is that it is much easier to render colour bleeding (the red and blue on the back wall)
and caustics (the refraction of light through the glass bunny) compared to using standard raytracing.</p></br>
