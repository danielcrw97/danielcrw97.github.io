<p>The following include personal, academic and professional projects on which I've worked on as a programmer.
The title acts as a link to the source code where available.</p>

<h2>Grand Theft Auto VI</h2></br>
<p>Working as a Gameplay/AI Programmer on the upcoming latest iteration of the critically acclaimed Grand Theft Auto series.</p></br>

<h2>Jurassic World Evolution 2</h2></br>
<p>Worked as a Gameplay Programmer on the dinosaur management game Jurassic World Evolution 2.
Worked on areas such as weapon firing, park management, crowd simulation and staff AI. The title is currently available on steam with Very Positive reviews <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244460/Jurassic_World_Evolution_2/>here.</a></p></br>

<h2>Jurassic World Evolution: Return To Jurassic Park</h2></br>
<p>Jurassic World Evolution is a park sim game where you run your own version of Jurassic Park. I worked as a gameplay programmer on the DLC Return To Jurassic Park, 
implementing features and fixing defects. The title was released on steam to positive reception and can be found <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144410/Jurassic_World_Evolution_Return_To_Jurassic_Park/>here.</a></br></br>

<h2> <a href=https://github.com/danielcrw97/Photon-Mapping>Photon Mapping (C++)</a></h2></br>
<p>The following is a ray tracer built from scratch (the only library used was an image reader). The project uses photon mapping to solve the
problem of global illumination, sending 'photons' out from light sources and storing them in data structures called KD-trees. 
The result (as can be seen in the example image below) is that it is able to render colour bleeding and caustics as an addition to standard raytracing.</br>

<h2> <a href=https://github.com/danielcrw97/LightingGamePrototype>Brackeys Game Jam (Unity/C#)</a></h2></br>
<p>A prototype created for the Brackeys game jam within Unity, along with an artist and a sound designer. 
The premise of the game is that light is a finite resource that is used to be able to see and scare away enemies, 
and can only be recharged at certain checkpoints.</br></br>

A list of features added, and my retrospective thoughts on the project can be found on the GitHub readme.</p></br>

<h2> <a href=https://github.com/danielcrw97/CMinus-Interpreter-And-Compiler>Functional C Interpreter and Compiler (C++)</a></h2></br>
<p>This project is an interpreter and a compiler for a functional C like language that only uses integers and functions as
return types (named CMinus).</br></br>

Lexical scoping is implemented for the language (using nested symbol tables). For syntax examples that show what the program
can interpret/compile, see the GitHub page readme.</p></br>

<h2> <a href=https://github.com/danielcrw97/TicTacToe-Minimax>Unbeatable TicTacToe (C++)</a></h2></br>

<p>One of my first C++ projects that I created while learning about AI. Uses a MiniMax algorithm
with alpha beta pruning for efficiency to create a TicTacToe AI that cannot be beaten.</p></br>
