<p> The following are some personal and academic projects for which I was the sole programmer.
Click on the title of each one for a link to the source code.</p>

<h2> <a href=https://github.com/danielcrw97/Photon-Mapping>Photon Mapping (C++)</a></h2></br>
<p>Global lighting is the problem of rendering non-direct light in Computer Graphics. This project uses photon mapping to solve the
problem, sending 'photons' out from light sources and storing them in special data structures called photon maps. These maps make it 
more efficient to find the closest photons during raytracing, and therefore make it easier to simulate all light paths.</br></br>

The result (as can be seen in the example image below) is that it is much easier to render colour bleeding (the red and blue on the back wall)
and caustics (the refraction of light through the glass bunny) compared to using standard raytracing.</p></br>

<h2> <a href=https://github.com/danielcrw97/LightingGamePrototype>Brackeys Game Jam (Unity/C#)</a></h2></br>
<p>A prototype created for the Brackeys game jam in under a week along with an artist and a sound designer. 
The premise of the game is that light is a finite resource that is used to be able to see and scare away enemies, 
and can only be recharged at certain checkpoints.</br></br>

A list of features added, and my retrospective thoughts on the project can be found on the GitHub readme.</p></br>

<h2> <a https://github.com/danielcrw97/CMinus-Interpreter-And-Compiler>Functional C Interpreter and Compiler (C++)</a></h2></br>
<p>This project is an interpreter and a compiler for a functional C like language that only uses integers and functions as
return types (named CMinus).</br></br>

Lexical scoping is implemented for the language (using nested symbol tables). For syntax examples that show what the program
can interpret/compile, see the GitHub page readme.</p>

<h2> <a https://github.com/danielcrw97/CMinus-Interpreter-And-Compiler>Unbeatable TicTacToe (C++)</a></h2></br>

<p>One of my first C++ projects that I used to start teaching myself basic AI algoriths. Uses a MiniMax algorithm
with alpha beta pruning for efficiency to create a TicTacToe AI that cannot be beaten.</p></br>
