<p>My name is Daniel Crowe, and I am a 23 year old maths graduate currently working as a gameplay programmer at Frontier Developments.<br/><br/>

As an aspiring game developer, I am passionate about video games and creating cohesive game experiences. I love the challenge of solving
problems, namely in the areas of gameplay, AI and graphics. To solve these problems I use a mix of the technical skills I have gained at
university along with the game specific knowledge I have gained from multiple sources (books, videos, articles etc.).<br/><br/>

Besides games, I have multiple other areas I am passionate about. I am a massive football fan, I love fiction in most mediums 
(films, TV and books) and I am also a drummer in a band, potentially coming to a pub near you. <br/><br/>

If you think I might be a good fit for your company, feel free to either check out <a href="assets/Dan Crowe CV.pdf" download>my resume,</a> have
