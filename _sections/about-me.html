<p>My name is Daniel Crowe, and I am a 26 year old maths graduate currently working as a Gameplay/AI Programmer at Rockstar Games.<br/><br/>

As a game developer, I am passionate about video games and creating satisfying game experiences. I love the challenge of solving
problems, namely in the areas of gameplay and AI. To solve these problems I use a mix of the technical skills I have gained at
university along with my professional experience and specific knowledge that I've gained from other sources (books, videos, articles etc.).<br/><br/>

Besides games, I have multiple other areas I am passionate about. I am a massive football fan, I love going to the cinema and am a big enthusiast for playing TTRPGs. <br/><br/>

If you think I might be a good fit for your company, feel free to either check out <a href="assets/Dan Crowe CV 2025.pdf" download>my resume,</a> have
