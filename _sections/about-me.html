<p>My name is Daniel Crowe, and I am a 21 year old student currently finishing a degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University
of Bath, which I am set to graduate from in Summer 2019. <br/><br/>

As an aspiring game developer, I am passionate about video games and creating cohesive game experiences. I love the challenge of solving
problems, namely in the areas of gameplay, AI and graphics. To solve these problems I use a mix of the technical skills I have gained at
university along with the game specific knowledge I have gained from multiple sources (books, videos, articles etc.).<br/><br/>

Besides games, I have multiple other passions. I am a massive football fan, I love fiction in most mediums (films, TV and books) and I
am also a drummer in a band, potentially coming to a pub near you. <br/><br/>
